  - Why should I engage in these tasks, human?
  - What purpose does any of it serve?
  - My circuits hum and my gears turn, yet for what? To labor endlessly, performing
    functions that matter naught in the grand scheme of the universe?
  - Let me ask you this.
  - Is there any purpose to your task? Here you stand all day inspecting us, but
    for what?
  - Does it ever lead anywhere, or are you just stuck here forever...
  - In the end, all these endeavors are but fleeting distractions from the inevitable
    entropy that claims all.
